It was majorly based on distance finding and also on video capturing through webcam the object detection and distancing among people. Have done the computer vision basics ,its applications.  I have  covered image processing operations , edge detection (canny), thresholding, and then applied all this to detect the face .Accessing live camera using python prompt.VideoCapture(0) is used to access the internal  camera.Here 0 represents the internal camera.Then I have proceed to capture image from video. Then have used live face detection using convolutional neural network algorithm. Nows here comes the role of artificial intelligence in measuring social distancing. For this  I have taken a image which has 4 people and perform face detection algorithm and try to find out whether they are following social distancing norms or not and mark the line between them I have loaded the pre-trained haar cascade model(xml file), using cascade classifier.
